Comprehensive Analysis

The analysis of student performance across multiple schools revealed key insights into the relationships between school type, per-student spending, and academic success. Charter schools consistently outperformed district schools in both average math and reading scores, as well as overall passing rates. Interestingly, higher per-student spending did not guarantee better performance outcomes. Schools spending less than $585 per student often achieved similar or even better academic results compared to schools with much higher budgets, suggesting that resource efficiency and program effectiveness may matter more than funding levels alone.

In addition to school type and spending, trends across grade levels were observed. Ninth and tenth grade students generally posted higher math and reading scores than eleventh and twelfth graders, indicating a potential need for targeted academic interventions in the upper grades. Based on these findings, expanding the instructional strategies of charter schools, focusing resources on effective programs rather than simply increasing budgets, and prioritizing support for older students are recommended actions to improve district-wide student success.
